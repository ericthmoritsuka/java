# My Java annotations  
Here is where I will add the files with annotations I have taken during my Java course at Udemy.

Here is the [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) to the course.

You can find the files divided by sections just like in the course.
There are annotations in some of them. The Coding Exercises are in separate folders.

I am currently using INTELLIJ as the IDE.
